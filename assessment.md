# Team Collaboration & Professional Integrity Assessment

### Instructions

*Please select the option that most closely aligns with how you would realistically handle the situation described. There are no "right" or "wrong" answers, only different approaches to workplace dynamics.*

---

### **Scenario 1: The Bottleneck**

A cross-functional project is due tomorrow. You have completed your portion perfectly, but a teammate is behind because they struggled with a technical hurdle. This teammate is your peer.

* **A)** Send your completed work to the manager immediately to show you’ve met your deadline.
* **B)** Offer to hop on a call with the teammate to share your process and help them troubleshoot.
* **C)** Wait for the teammate to ask for help; you don’t want to overstep or make them feel incompetent.
* **D)** Check your work one more time to ensure your "A+" is secured, then head home.

### **Scenario 2: The Knowledge Discovery**

You’ve discovered a shortcut in the company software that saves you two hours of manual data entry every week.

* **A)** Keep it to yourself so you can use that extra time for personal projects and stand out.
* **B)** Mention it to your manager during your next 1-on-1 to show your individual innovation.
* **C)** Document the process and share it with the team so everyone can save time.
* **D)** Use the shortcut but only share it if you see someone else specifically struggling.

### **Scenario 3: The Unearned Praise**

During a meeting, your manager praises you for a brilliant idea that was actually sparked by a casual comment a teammate made during lunch.

* **A)** Accept the praise; it was your execution that made the idea work anyway.
* **B)** Thank the manager, then privately tell the teammate later that you appreciated their input.
* **C)** Immediately speak up: "I can't take full credit; [Name] brought up the core concept."
* **D)** Say "The team worked hard on this," without naming the specific person.

### **Scenario 4: The Ownership Dilemma**

A client sends an urgent request that falls into a "gray area"—it’s not strictly your job, but the person who handles it is out sick. The client is getting frustrated.

* **A)** Explain to the client that the responsible party is out and give them a return date.
* **B)** Try to resolve the issue yourself to protect the team’s reputation and help the client.
* **C)** Forward the email to your manager so they can decide who should handle it.
* **D)** Ignore the email; responding might set a precedent that you are now responsible for this.

### **Scenario 5: The Team Mistake**

Your team missed a deadline. Your manager asks the group what went wrong. You know it was because a teammate forgot an approval, but you also could have checked in on them.

* **A)** Stay silent and let the teammate explain themselves; it’s their responsibility.
* **B)** Say, "It was a breakdown in communication. I should have followed up to confirm."
* **C)** Message the manager after the meeting to clarify exactly whose fault it was.
* **D)** Make up a technical excuse (like a server error) to keep everyone out of trouble.

### **Scenario 6: The Documentation Request**

You lead a complex process only you know. Your manager asks for a "How-To" manual so others can step in if you are ever unavailable.

* **A)** Create a brief outline but leave out the nuances; some things are better learned by doing.
* **B)** Create a comprehensive guide so simple that a junior member could handle it.
* **C)** Suggest it’s more efficient for you to just do it, as teaching others takes too long.
* **D)** Use the request as leverage to ask for a promotion or raise before sharing the info.

### **Scenario 7: The Weekend Emergency**

It is Saturday. An urgent issue arises that requires info only you have. Your manager asks for 10 minutes of your time.

* **A)** Ignore the message until Monday; weekends are a strictly "no-work" zone.
* **B)** Provide the info quickly, then suggest a meeting Monday to ensure others have this info.
* **C)** Handle the issue, but remind the manager Monday how "lost" the team would be without you.
* **D)** Block work contacts during off-hours to ensure your time is never interrupted.

## **Evaluation Guide & Red Flags**

### **The "Ideal" Profile**

* **Answers:** 1-B, 2-C, 3-C, 4-B, 5-B, 6-B, 7-B.
* **Characteristics:** High ownership, radical honesty, and views "Documentation" as a gift to the team rather than a threat to their job security.

### **🚩 Red Flags to Observe**

**1. The "Hero Complex" (Self-Importance)**

* **Indicator:** Chooses **7-C** or **6-C**.
* **The Trap:** This person wants to be the only one who can save the day. They will purposefully not train others so they can remain "irreplaceable."

**2. The "Silo" Mentality (Inward-Facing)**

* **Indicator:** Chooses **1-A**, **2-A**, or **4-D**.
* **The Trap:** This person sees their job as a checklist. If it’s not on their list, they don’t care if the team fails. They view colleagues as competitors.

**3. The "Credit Hog" (Moral Weakness)**

* **Indicator:** Chooses **3-A** or **5-C**.
* **The Trap:** This person deflects blame and absorbs praise. This is the fastest way to destroy team morale and trust.

**4. Rigid Boundary Distortion**

* **Indicator:** Chooses **7-A** or **7-D**.
* **The Trap:** While work-life balance is important, a total refusal to help during a *rare* emergency suggests they don't feel a moral tie to the team’s collective success.
