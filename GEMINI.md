# Directory Context: Self-Assessment

## Overview
This directory contains materials for a **Team Collaboration & Professional Integrity Assessment**. It is a non-code project designed to evaluate individuals on their balance between professional competence and team-oriented morality. The content focuses on uncovering behavioral traits such as knowledge hoarding, accountability, and collaboration.

## Key Files
*   **`assessment.md`**: The core document containing:
    *   **Instructions**: How to approach the assessment.
    *   **7 Scenarios**: Real-world workplace dilemmas (e.g., "The Bottleneck," "The Knowledge Discovery") with multiple-choice reactions.
    *   **Evaluation Guide**: A key for interpreting answers, identifying "Ideal" profiles, and spotting "Red Flags" like the "Hero Complex" or "Silo Mentality."

## Usage
This assessment is intended for:
1.  **Self-Reflection**: Individuals can answer the scenarios to gauge their own workplace instincts.
2.  **Hiring/Team Building**: Managers can use these scenarios as interview questions to assess cultural fit.
3.  **Workshop Discussion**: Teams can discuss the scenarios to align on expected behaviors and values.

To use, simply read through `assessment.md`, select the answers that match your likely behavior, and compare them against the "Evaluation Guide" at the bottom of the file.
